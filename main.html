	 <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time Â  
 an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the input size. A more efficient algorithm takes less time to complete its task. 
  </p>

  <p>Space complexity is the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. An algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the memory usage grows linearly with the input size.
